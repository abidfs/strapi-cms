# üöÄ Strapi CMS

Strapi comes with a full featured [Command Line Interface](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.html)
(CLI) which lets you scaffold and manage your project in seconds.

### `prerequisites`

To use Strapi, it is necessary to have an active `MySQL` instance as the data source. Fortunately, there is a convenient way to start a local `MySQL` instance using `docker-compose`. You can initiate it effortlessly by executing the following command:

```
docker-compose up strapi-mysql adminer
```

This will start the `MySQL` instance within Docker. Additionally, it will also start the `adminer` instance, which serves as a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for connecting to `MySQL` and exploring the database.<br>
Simply visit http://localhost:7000 in the browser to access the `adminer` GUI.<br><br>

### `install`

Install dependencies

```
yarn install
```

<br>

### `develop`

Start your `Strapi` application in `development` mode with `autoReload` enabled. [Learn more](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.html#strapi-develop)

```
yarn develop
```

Simply visit http://localhost:1337/admin in the browser to access the `strapi` admin panel.<br>
You may also need to setup admin account with dummy values, if you are opening `strapi` for the very first time.<br><br>

### `start`

Start your `Strapi` application in `production` mode with `autoReload` disabled. [Learn more](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.html#strapi-start)

```
yarn start
```

<br>

### `build`

Build your `strapi` admin panel. [Learn more](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.html#strapi-build)

```
yarn build
```

<br>

### `docker-compose`

To launch `Strapi` and its dependencies in `docker-compose` mode, you can effortlessly start them by executing the following command.

```
docker-compose up
```

This will start the `Strapi` instance within Docker. Additionally, it will also start the `MySQL` and `adminer` instances. These all instances are configured to live in the same docker network and talk to each other.<br>
Simply visit http://localhost:1337/admin in the browser to access the `strapi` admin panel.<br>
Simply visit http://localhost:7000 in the browser to access the `adminer` GUI.<br><br>
